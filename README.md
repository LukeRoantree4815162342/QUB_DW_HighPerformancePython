# QUB Development Weeks: High Performance Python
Code and more for the QUB Development Weeks event 'High Performance Python'

---
## Getting Started:

1) Check if Anaconda is installed - this isn't essential in general for using Python, as there is other ways to set up and use Python, but 
to avoid runing into versioning problems between different Python / library distributions I'm standardising this course with conda
environments - which means you'll be installing the same version of Python as I'm using as I give this course, as well as the same
versions of the same external packages that I use - in a temporary virtual environment that won't mess up any other Python installs you have.
To check if anaconda is installed properly, open a terminal (Windows - search Command Prompt or git-bash, MacOS - search terminal, linux - you know how)
In the terminal run "conda list". If you get a list of packages, or even anything other than "no command found" or similar - you're all good! 
Close the terminal now.

2) If not already installed, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

3) At this point I'll assume I've shown you how to download / clone this repository (or you already knew how and did it yourself). Open a terminal
in this directory (where this repository is):

> Windows - in file manager, navigate to this repo, right click anywhere and click 'command prompt here'
> MacOS - in Finder, navigate to this repo, then (top left of screen) click 'Finder'-\>Services-\>'new Terminal at Folder'
> Linux - cd to this repo

and run "conda create  --name qubcourse  --file conda\_package\_list.txt python=3.7.5", which will create a new virtual environment, with a specific version of Python,
and will install the same versions of the same packages I had installed when I made this course.

This will take a while, so I'll probably have started going through the earlier parts of the course during these downloading and installing.

4) In your terminal, still in this directory, run "jupyter notebook" - this should cause a webpage to open, with a list of what's in this directory. To start with,
click on the 'PythonRefresher.ipynb' link.


That's us fully set up and started!
